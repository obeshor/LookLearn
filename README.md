# LookLearn
As part of the VR Nanodegree Program at Udacity,  TeamWork project is proposed in order to meet others classmates  in the process of design a VR app to practice their VR chops and learn how to develop creative software in a small team. Our team "Team Burn" sought to create an educational app for young children teaching them nursery rhymes and colors! Itâ€™s a fun, well designed childrens bedroom that encourages interactivity with colors and objects
